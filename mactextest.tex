%Section: Summary
\section{Summary}
I'm a Software Engineer always interested in the success of every project that i'm involved. 
I love a good challenge and making part of awesome ideas that can make a difference on their market.
My expectations are to find that ideas or to be able to execute some of mine with tight and motivated teams.
Right now, my main focus lies on software stack's that encompass CEP technologies, but i'm very much interested in Machine Learning, Stock Markets, BioTechnologies and all fields or markets
that spark my inspiration.

  \textsc{2009 - present} & \emph{Software and CEP Engineer} at \textbf{PT Comunicações}, Lisboa\\ 
  & \begin{compactitem} 
     \item Developed and engineered several components for the fifth generation of a monitoring platform for IT infrastructures and Business Processes. The main components where i was involved
     where a DSL Parser to describe IT Infrastructures and several set's of rules for a ESP/CEP engine. I have also continued to develop components for the previous version of the aforementioned
     monitoring platform.

  \textsc{2008 - 2009} & \emph{Software and CEP Engineer} at \textbf{PT Comunicações}, Lisboa\\ 
  & \begin{compactitem} 
     \item Developed and engineered several components for the fourth generation of a monitoring platform for IT infrastructures and Business Processes.
     The bulk of my work was to re-factor and maintain Windows monitoring agents, develop an ETL infrastructure to handle agent events on the server side, develop set's of rules for a ESP/CEP 
     engine,  to correlate agent and businesses events from several sources.
     \end{compactitem}\vspace{-1em} \\
  & \begin{compactitem} 
     \item Planed and executed load and stress tests on some company product public websites.

%should refer here that i also was one of the core developers for a CEP solution that was giving the first steps on the BI/CEP marriage 
  \textsc{2007 - 2008} & Intern developer at \textbf{PT Comunicações}, Lisboa\\ 
   & \begin{compactitem}
   \item Developed core components and monitoring agents for the fourth generation of an "in house" monitoring solution, using my knowledge acquired while working on my final project.
   \end{compactitem}\vspace{-1em} \\
  & \begin{compactitem}
   \item Finished my college final project entitled "Middleware Security, Performance Monitoring and Analysis" with final score of 18 on a scale between 0 and 20.
   The main goals of my final project where the following: 
   \begin{description}
		\item[] Identify QoS, QoP and QoM indexes for the most used Middleware platforms in PT Comunicações. In that time where Microsoft Biztalk and Tibco Rendezvous;
   \end{description}
   \begin{description}
		\item[] Develop midleware monitoring agents to extract relevant information that can be correlated to produce QoS, QoP and QoM indexes;
   \end{description}
      \begin{description}
		\item[] Develop a set of rules in SEC (Simple Event Correlator) to produce the desired indexes;

\section{Interests and Activities}
Physical exercise is one off my favorite hobbies and i always try to save some time on my day to do some running, lift weighting, indoor fitness classes, martial arts or play a football game.
Besides my main interests in ESP, CEP, Machine Learning, etc, i also try to keep up with the current hot topics such as Social Web, Online Piracy legislation, Patent Wars, BioTech and so many more.
On my commute time i love to read or listen to audiobooks and my tastes tend to fall on the Science Fiction or Technology/Engineering domains.
