%Section: Summary
\section{Summary}
I am a Software Engineer and am always interested in the success of every project that I am involved with. Educated in the midst of the Java ecosystem while in college and I’ve gained considerable commercial experience using it daily, but I’ve also fell in love with the (J)Ruby world while doing my internship. Studying at Universidade Nova has taught me proficiency in assimilating new languages, paradigms, and styles, and I am confident in using them to solve specific problems and build complex systems. Being a Blue Ocean enthusiast I want to be a part of awesome ideas that can cast a brand new look over the existing markets. My expectations are to find a company motivated with breaking away from the status quo, where I can make a difference on their growth and where my ideas can be put into action. Right now, my main focus lies in software stack’s that encompass (C)ESP (Complex Event Stream Processing) and BigData technologies, but I’m always eager to learn, create and excel in any field. I’m particularly interested in Machine Learning, Financial Markets, Biotech, IoT, but I’m happy with any domain that sparks my inspiration.

  & \begin{compactitem} 
     \item As a member of a R\&D team, I was responsible to maintain a proactive search of open source technologies that the company could benefit from. It was expected the development of PoC projects that could evaluate the effectiveness of one or more technologies while making use of real company data.

  	%architechted? check this one 
     \item Architected and developed several components for the forth and fifth generation of a monitoring platform for IT infrastructures and Business Processes. The major components where I was involved where: a DSL Parser to describe the most common company IT Infrastructures; a service to run a well know CEP engine and to process incoming monitoring events; the middleware to support message flow between the front-end API services and all the monitoring platform components; several set's of rules and heuristics for the CEP engine and some integration components such as ETL processes and message queue integration processes.
     \end{compactitem}\vspace{-1em} \\
  & \begin{compactitem} 
     \item 
     Implemented several monitoring projects for company critical business
activities, applications and systems. Those projects required investigative
work with the application development teams and owners, proactive search
for useful information in the company systems and applications, make and
put into action a monitoring plan that included a useful set of metrics, KPI
and alarms. These projects where materialized making use of the in- house
developed monitoring platform, and I extending it if needed.
     \end{compactitem}\vspace{-1em} \\
  & \begin{compactitem} 
     \item
     Architected and developed several monitoring agents for Windows based
systems. Those agents where installed in the servers that supported the
most critical business applications of the company. They had the capability
of extracting virtually any measurement from the system. They were also
capable of monitoring and extracting log files or Event Log entries in real
time.

   Architected and developed core components and monitoring agents for the
fourth generation of an in-house monitoring solution, using the acquired
knowledge gained while working on my final project at college.

	Programming Languages
	%making use of the java ecosystem usual suspects
	& {\bf Java} - Making use of the common Java ecosystem development tools and
frameworks such as JUnit, Spring and Maven2, I’ve written several components,
from monitoring agents integrated with TIBCO Hawk to Esper engine loaders.  \\
	& {\bf JRuby\textbackslash Ruby} - Wrote ETLs, private gems with API’s for internal company services, DSLs, Esper engine loaders, I/O adapters, etc..\\
	& {\bf C\# } -Architected
Developed a Windows service responsible for loading micro-agents that extract
system measurements from the PT Portugal Server and Desktop park, ad-hoc logs
and Eventlog samples. Also made an API available to third parties to develop their own micro-agents.\\
	& {\bf Objective C} - Used it while developing in iOS\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
	Complex Event and Stream Processing Engines
	& {\bf Esper} - Implemented several rule set’s to correlate events from mission-critical
business processes that require near real time attention such as sales, home
equipment malfunction report incidents, IVR calls, etc..\\
	& {\bf SEC} - Used as event correlator for minor projects. \\
	& {\bf Drools} - Evaluated while comparing with Esper as the go to CESP engine for my team projects. \\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

\section{Interests and Activities}
Physical exercise is one of my favorite hobbies and I always try to save some time
in my day to do some running, weighting lifting, indoor fitness classes, martial arts
or playing football. Besides my main interests in ESP, CEP, Machine Learning,
BigData, etc., I also try to keep up with the current hot topics such as Social Web,
Online piracy legislation, patent wars and so many more. In my free time I love
to read or listen to audiobooks and my tastes tend to fall on the Science Fiction
or Technology/Engineering domains. While working at PT Portugal I was also
actively involved in two startups - one in the discount card business and one in the
spirits business.
