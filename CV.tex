%Section: Summary
\section{Summary}
I'm a Software Engineer always interested in the success of every project that i'm involved.
Educated on the Java ecosystem in college and further gained experience with it with day to day work but I've fallen in love with the (J)Ruby world after being introduced to Rails.
Being a Blue Ocean enthusiast i want to be a part of awesome ideas that can cast a brand new look over the existing markets.
My expectations are to find a company motivated with breaking away from the status-quo, where i can make a difference on their growth and where my ideas can be put in place.
Right now, my main focus lies in software stack's that encompass CEP technologies, but  I'm always eager to learn, create and excel in any field. 
I'm particularly interested in Machine Learning, Financial Markets, BioTech, IoT, and all fields or markets that spark my inspiration.

\begin{tabular}{rp{11cm}}
  \textsc{2008 - present} & \emph{Software and CEP Engineer} at \textbf{Portugal Telecom}, Lisboa\\ 
  & \begin{compactitem} 
     \item Developed and engineered several components for the fifth generation of a monitoring platform for IT infrastructures and Business Processes. The main components where i was involved
     where a DSL Parser to describe IT Infrastructures and several set's of rules for a ESP/CEP engine. I have also continued to develop components for the previous version of the aforementioned
     monitoring platform.
     \end{compactitem}\vspace{-1em} \\
  & \begin{compactitem} 
     \item Developed and engineered several components for the fourth generation of a monitoring platform for IT infrastructures and Business Processes.
     The bulk of my work was to write, re-factor and maintain a set of Windows monitoring agents, develop an ETL infrastructure to handle agent events and to develop set's of rules for a ESP/CEP 
     engine,  to correlate agent and businesses events from several sources. I also lead several smaller internal projects.
     \end{compactitem}\vspace{-1em} \\
  & \begin{compactitem} 
     \item Planned and executed load and stress tests on critical product public websites.

%should refer here that i also was one of the core developers for a CEP solution that was giving the first steps on the BI/CEP marriage 
  \textsc{2007 - 2008} & Intern developer at \textbf{Portugal Telecom}, Lisboa\\ 
   & \begin{compactitem}
   \item Developed core components and monitoring agents for the fourth generation of an "in house" monitoring solution, using the acquired knowledge while working on my college final project.
   \end{compactitem}\vspace{-1em} \\
  & \begin{compactitem}
   \item Finished my college final project entitled "Middleware Security, Performance Monitoring and Analysis" with final grade of 18/20.
   The main goals of my final project where the following: 
   \begin{description}
		\item[] Identify QoS, QoP and QoM indexes for the most critical Middleware platforms in Portugal Telecom. At that time they were Microsoft Biztalk and Tibco Rendezvous;
   \end{description}
   \begin{description}
		\item[] Develop middleware monitoring agents to extract relevant information that can be correlated to produce QoS, QoP and QoM indexes;
   \end{description}
      \begin{description}
		\item[] Develop a set of rules in SEC (Simple Event Correlator) to produce the desired indexes;

\section{Interests and Activities}
Physical exercise is one of my favorite hobbies and i always try to save some time on my day to do some running, lift weighting, indoor fitness classes, martial arts or play football.
Besides my main interests in ESP, CEP, Machine Learning, BigData, etc , i also try to keep up with the current hot topics such as Social Web, Online Piracy legislation, Patent Wars, BioTech, Stock Market trends and so many more.
On my commute time i love to read or listen to audiobooks and my tastes tend to fall on the Science Fiction or Technology/Engineering domains.
